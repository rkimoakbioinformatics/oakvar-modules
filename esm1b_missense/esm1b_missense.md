# esm1b_snp annotator

This annotator module is for Single-nucleotide polymorphism Variant Effect Predictions using the deep protein language model ESM1b.

## ESM1b Protein Language Model

The SNP Annotator Module, built on the advanced ESM1b protein language model, provides Likelihood Ratio (LLR) scores for missense variants in the human genome, aiding in distinguishing between pathogenic and benign variants. Using an LLR threshold of -7.5, it achieves a true-positive rate of 81% and a true-negative rate of 82%, ensuring high reliability for variant effect prediction. The ESM1b model accurately predicts the effects of missense variants across 42,336 protein isoforms and is validated against extensive datasets, making it a robust tool for genetic analysis.
