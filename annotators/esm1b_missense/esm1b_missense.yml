  desc: The “LLR Score Threshold” determines the significance of a mutation score. The Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) measures how likely a given amino acid change is functionally significant compared to a neutral change. For this test, an LLR score lower than -7.5 is considered pathogenic, indicating a strong likelihood that the mutation is detrimental.
